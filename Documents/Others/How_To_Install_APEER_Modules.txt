Dendrite Arm Spacing via OAD_updated_APAC_07052021.zip file contains the ZEN Core Job for computing the Dendrite Arm Spacing in input images. 

For executing this ZEN Core Job, the user has to download 3 APEER Modules which can be done as explained below: 

1) Below is the APEER access token that the user can put under “Maintenance” -> “General Options” -> “APEER” which allows one to import the necessary APEER modules. 

    Access token: 9VkLstmTJ1pSzYikXIYzJSW59RrlHPMc9YLt3lMXZNs

2 )The three modules that are needed should be the only private or shared modules namely:
   1. “find_peaks_insert_dots”
   2. “group_dots_calculate_measurements”
   3. “Create_xml_from_czi_and_insert_profile_in_xml”

3) The user can import these APEER Modules under “Manage Template” -> “Show APEER Modules” then click on the cloud icon in the top right and only check the “Shared Modules” checkbox. 
   The three modules should be listed and you can download them there.

Now, this ZEN Core Job can be executed for the user-selected input image.
